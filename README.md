# Durandal GHFiddle

### What is it?

A cut-down version of [Durandal], hosted as Github repo with only one gh-pages branch.

### What is it good for?

JSFiddle et al. are all great when there's a need to fiddling with CSS/JavaScript/HTML snipets or 
sharing code during discussions on stackoverflow or newsgroups. 

Unfortuanately, due to the nature of Durandal that encourgae you to break down apps in many smaller modules and then use 
 [composition] to stich them back together, those apps are no longer at their sweet spot, because there's no easy way to 
deal with multiple smaller files.

Durandal GHFiddle to the rescue.

### How to use?


+ Step 1: Fork the repo (hint there's a fork button in the upper right) 
+ Step 2: Be patient and wait a little (about 10 min). By default the live version will be accessible using an URL like  http://YourUserName.github.io/Durandal-Fiddle. 
+ Step 3: To get you started there are 3 demo fiddles under `app/fiddles`. Use github's online editor to modify them https://github.com/YourUserName/Durandal-Fiddle/App/fiddles



Share the link to your demo (running at http://YourUserName.github.io/Durandal-Fiddle) and share the code snippets (stored at https://github.com/YourUserName/Durandal-Fiddle)
 
Enjoy,

Rainer
