# Durandal GHFiddle

### What is it?

A cut-down [Durandal] version hosted as Github repo with only one gh-pages branch.

### What is it good for?

JSFiddle et al. are all great when it comes to provide an easy way to fiddle around 
with CSS/JavaScript/HTML snipets, share code and ask for help on stackoverflow or newsgroups. 
Due to the nature of Durandal that encourgae you to break down apps in many smaller modules and then use 
 [composition] to stich them back together this won't work very well in JSFiddle et.al.

Durandal GHFiddle to the rescue.

### How to use?

Step 1: Clone the repo
Step 2: You find 3 demo fiddles under `app/fiddles`
Step 3: Use github online editing capabilities to update the fiddles
